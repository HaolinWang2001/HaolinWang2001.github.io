Hello and welcome to my personal page!  
My name is Haolin Wang and I am a recent graduate from the University of Sheffield with Master in Data Analytics. My academic background has equipped me with a strong foundation in machine learning, data analysis and mathematics. I am currently seeking a job as a data scientist or data analyst where I can apply my skills to solve real-world problems and help businesses make data-driven decisions.  

Aside from my formal education and work experience, I love to take online courses to fill the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical skills. These are some Coursera courses I have taken:

[Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)  
[SQL for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science/home/welcome)  
[Python and Pandas for Data Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-and-pandas-for-data-engineering-duke/home/welcome)  
[Supply Chain Logistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/supply-chain-logistics/home/welcome)(I did this to get prepared for my internship at Amazon Transportation Service, and it was fun)


Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal page. My CV could be viewed [here](https://haolinwang2001.github.io/cv/). Please feel free to contact me via email or phone if you have any questions or if you would like to discuss potential job opportunities.
